# Utility Network extension for CityJSON

This repository contains an Extension for the [CityJSON](https://www.cityjson.org) schema to support Utility Networks.

The development is still in progress and the schema should not be used for production.

## Relation with the Utility Network ADE
The development of this Extension is based on the [Utility Network ADE](https://github.com/TatjanaKutzner/CityGML-UtilityNetwork-ADE) for the [CityGML standard](https://www.ogc.org/standards/citygml), although it does not (and it is not intended to) fully support all the features of the ADE.

The attributes and - to some extent - the hierarchy of the objects are derived from those of the ADE.

## Roadmap
- Support for District Heating Networks
- Integration with an Extension for Energy 

## Contributions
Interested users are encouraged to contribute to the development of this Extension, by participating to discussions, code reviews or submitting pull requests.
